This is an obsidian plugin I have developed for my personal use.

This plugin will provide following features:
- Automatically generates Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly Reviews, along with daily notes from command palette, within a designated folder for each interval.
- The Pomodoro timer can be started, paused, and resumed through the ribbon icon, with the timer displayed in the status bar. You can also stop the timer midway using the command palette and customize your preferred time intervals in the settings.
